# Hiragana-Learner-Terminal
A small hiragana drill program made for use in the windows terminal.

I created this program for my friends and I to help us learn the hiragana characters. After creating a distributed exe that does not rely on the Racket REPL,
I discovered hiragana characters can not be displayed on the windows terminal normally. I will work on a GUI version that can be distrubuted, but I quite liked this
program so I decided to upload it anyway. If someone trying to learn hiragana finds this before I finish the GUI version, running it in the Racket REPL 
should work perfectly
