# Hiragana-Learner-Terminal
A small hiragana drill program made for use in the windows terminal.

I created this program for my friends and I to help us learn the hiragana characters. After creating a distributed exe that does not rely on the Racket REPL,
I discovered hiragana characters can not be displayed on the windows terminal normally. I will work on a GUI version that can be distrubuted, but I quite liked this
program due to the use of continuations and metaprogramming even if they were not the most efficent method of doing this. 
If someone trying to learn hiragana finds this before I finish the GUI version, running it in the Racket REPL should work perfectly.
